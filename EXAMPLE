This example runs with this command line:
python modclick.py -t MyAtomtypesTable -l MyList -s -p 4 -o MyOutput

if pp module is not installed, you can avoid -p flag.

The MyList list contains superposition pairs of dinucleotide base pairs. 
PATH:./carpeta/
mejor_0.pdb,mejor_1.pdb
peor_0.pdb,peor_1.pdb
0.5_0.pdb,0.5_1.pdb

"PATH:" field is obligatory only if all files are in the same folder (in this case "carpeta"). 
If you want to use absolute paths you need to erase PATH: line

In this examples this six files contains dinucleotide pairs of DNA. However 0.5_1.pdb file doesn't 
exist so in the result file MyOutput this file will be written in parenthesis ().
